# snapcrafters/ci/test-snap-build

Designed to be a quick "smoke test" that doesn't require any special credentials or secrets. This
action tries to build the snap "locally" on the Github Actions runner for `amd64` only. Once the
snap is built, it is reviewed using [review-tools].

Information about your snap will be automatically parsed for the review stage. If you need to
specify plug or slot declarations per the [snapcraft-review-tools] README, you can include any of
the following files in your repository, which will be passed to the review action:

- `slot-declaration.json`
- `.github/slot-declaration.json`
- `plug-declaration.json`
- `.github/plug-declaration.json`

> [!NOTE]
> We don't use `remote-build` here, because that requires access to a Launchpad token.
> Exposing tokens in a PR build can be [dangerous] from a security standpoint.
