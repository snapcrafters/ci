There are a few style guidelines to keep in mind:

- Code should be linted using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). You can achieve this with `make lint` and `make format`. The only requirements are [`npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) and [`shellcheck`](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck).
- When defining inputs/outputs in `action.yaml`, or listing them in the tables within `README.md`, they should be listed in alphabetical order for easy reading and updating.
- Github Action inputs/outputs should be named all lowercase, separated by `-` where needed. The applies to inputs/outputs to actions themselves, and for individual steps within the actions. For example: `snap-name` or `token`.
- Environment variables referring to repository level secrets and variables should be named all uppercase, and separated by `_`. For example: `SNAPCRAFTERS_BOT_COMMIT`.
- Step/job level environment variables should be named all lowercase, and separated by `_`. For example: `snap_name` or `yaml_path`.
- All `bash` variables should be quoted.
- Scripts of all kinds, including those within actions `run:|` directives should follow the [Google styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)
