# snapcrafters/ci/call-for-testing

Automatically creates a templated call for testing as a Github issue, containing the details of
newly released revisions and instructions on how to test and promote them.

## Usage

### Use in combination with `snapcrafters/ci/release-to-candidate`

In this mode, the action will look for an artifact uploaded by the
`snapcrafters/ci/release-to-candidate` action that contains a manifest detailing the exact
revisions that were uploaded, and use those to populate the call for testing template.

```yaml
jobs:
  release:
    name: ðŸš¢ Release to latest/candidate
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: ðŸš¢ Release to latest/candidate
        uses: snapcrafters/ci/release-to-candidate@main
        with:
          architecture: arm64
          launchpad-token: ${{ secrets.LAUNCHPAD_TOKEN }}
          store-token: ${{ secrets.STORE_TOKEN }}

  call-for-testing:
    name: ðŸ“£ Create call for testing
    needs: release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: ðŸ“£ Create call for testing
        uses: snapcrafters/ci/call-for-testing@main
        with:
          architectures: "amd64 arm64"
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Use standalone - `store-token` required

In this mode, the action will use the store token to fetch the latest revision on the specified
channel (`candidate` by default) for each architecture and populate the call for testing with those
revisions.

```yaml
jobs:
  call-for-testing:
    name: ðŸ“£ Create call for testing
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: ðŸ“£ Create call for testing
        uses: snapcrafters/ci/call-for-testing@main
        with:
          architectures: "amd64 arm64"
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          store-token: ${{ secrets.STORE_TOKEN }}
```
