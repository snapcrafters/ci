# snapcrafters/ci/get-screenshots

Deploys the snap from the specified channel in a LXD desktop VM, then takes screenshots of the whole
desktop, and the most recent active window after the snap was launched. Screenshots are then
committed to [ci-screenshots](https://github.com/snapcrafters/ci-screenshots), and added to a comment on
the original call for testing issue.
