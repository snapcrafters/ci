# snapcrafters/ci/parse-snapcraft-yaml

This action is more for use internally than otherwise. It's purpose is to either find a snapcraft.yaml file from a list of known common locations in a repository, or take the path to a snapcraft.yaml, then parse some information from it and provide that information as outputs.

You only need to specify the `snapcraft-project-root` input if your `snapcraft.yaml` is not in one of the following locations:

- `.snapcraft.yaml`
- `build-aux/snap/snapcraft.yaml`
- `snap/snapcraft.yaml`
- `snapcraft.yaml`

The action will also try to locate files that can be used during the review phase to delcare plugs and slots. The default locations searched are:

- `slot-declaration.json`
- `.github/slot-declaration.json`
- `plug-declaration.json`
- `.github/plug-declaration.json`
